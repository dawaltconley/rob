# Main Help File

Hi! Welcome to prose.io! This is where you can edit the content of your site or add new content and post it online.

## Syntax

Most files (including this one) are formatted in Markdown, a simple syntax designed to convert easy-to-write plain text into web-readable HTML.

The buttons in your toolbar will help your format text the way you want, but keep in mind that it's not the _buttons_ that do anything, it's the **charachters** (like the asterisk and underscore) that change the way the text will be read and displayed. All these syntax rules are available [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

Markdown has many different flavors, and the kind we'll be working with is called _Kramdown_. It has additional capabilities, which you can read more about [here](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html). If, between Markdown and Kramdown, you still can't find what you're looking for, you can always write in-line HTML.

Most Markdown files will also contain **metadata**, which includes special information like the title and date. You can view the metadata for any file by clicking on the metadata icon on the right of the screen. Try it now!

## Adding Content

You are currently in the root directory of the your website. As you can see, the site is divided into folders. Each folder contains a different type of content, and files created in that folder will be read differently by the website, just by virtue of their location.

To add content, navigate to the appropriate folder and click the "New File" button at the top of the page, when viewing the folder contents. If you are wondering how to work with any particular type of file, check out the .help.md file located in that folder.

Some types of content require additional steps in order to publish. These steps are outlined in the relevant .help file.

## Saving

When you are finished editting a file, click on the save icon to open up the commit panel. In the text box, summarize the changes you just made (i.e. "added project" or "fixed typo"), then click commit. This will update or add the file to the GitHub repository and rebuild the site automatically.

While prose.io generally saves your content to the browser cache, I *highly recommend* that you use a seperate, local text editor when writing large posts or files. If your computer dies or the page refreshes, you may lose all of your progress (this is especially risky on mobile devices).

## Removing Content

You don't need to delete files in order to remove content from the website. See the relevant .help file for the best way to remove content from the site.
